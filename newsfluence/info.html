<h1 class="padding">How it works:</h1>
<p class="padding">The probability of your posts being liked or re-tweeted is based on a variety of human and non-human factors, and I believe, using a super-secret highly-advanced algorithm, to have uncovered those that are most important, producing a composite predictor score for news-sharing success. The criteria are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the news has already been broken by someone else in your network.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-seiter/a-guide-to-high-quality-s_b_5556249.html">time of day you post</a>.</li>
	<li>The mood of your story (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/science/good-news-spreads-faster-on-twitter-and-facebook.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&">happier = better!</a>).</li>
	<li>If it matches the interests of a majority of your friends / followers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="padding">I take each of these factors into account for each post, which in-turn allows you to make informed sharing decisions. <a href="main-page.html">See for yourself!</a></p>
